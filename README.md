# SegFormer From Scratch

![Demo](videos/campus_1224_370_SegFormer35epochs_output.gif)

*A high-performance semantic segmentation pipeline built end-to-end.*

This repository contains a complete implementation of SegFormer, recreated fully from scratch.

It demonstrates my ability to understand research papers, build complex deep learning architectures, and apply them to real-world perception tasks.

It includes all components: architecture design, efficient attention, dataset preparation, training pipelines, evaluation, and visualization tools.

## Project Overview

SegFormer is one of the most efficient and accurate transformer-based models for semantic segmentation.

In this project, I rebuilt SegFormer from the ground up, following the original architecture:

### 1. Core Implementation

* Full SegFormer architecture (MIT-B3)
* Overlapping patch embedding + hierarchical encoder
* Efficient attention modules
* Lightweight MLP decoder
* Clean utilities for training, testing, and visualization

### 2. Training Pipelines

* Cityscapes semantic segmentation
* Drivable area segmentation
* Evaluation metrics & inference scripts

### 3. Analysis & Visualization

* Attention map visualization
* Segmentation overlays
* Demo videos to showcase performance
